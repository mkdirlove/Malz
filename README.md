A. What are the procedures that will transpire during actual deployment of defense forward operations?

	Network Monitoring / Threat Hunting
	
		-Mr.Majestic 	: A tool/software that is used for network monitoring, threat hunting, malware analysis.
		-CarbonBlack 	: A software as a service (SaaS) solution that provides next-generation anti-virus (NGAV), endpoint detection and response (EDR), advanced threat hunting, and vulnerability management within a single console using a single sensor.
		-Splunk      	: A software that provides simplified threat management that facilitates quick threat detection and response and minimizes risk.
		-SecOnion	 	: A a free and open source alternative to expensive enterprise security solutions! Security Onion can be described as a Network Security Monitoring (NSM) platform that “provides context, intelligence and situational awareness of your network.”
		-Gigamon ASF-21 : A network TAP (test access point or terminal access point) is a fundamental element for acquiring network traffic.

	Malware Analysis / Reverse Engineering
	
		Virtual Appliance

			-FlareVM	: A collection of software installations scripts for Windows systems that allows you to easily setup and maintain a reverse engineering environment on a virtual machine (VM).
			-REMnux		: A Linux toolkit for reverse-engineering and analyzing malicious software. 
			
		Static Analysis
		
			-PEStudio	: A tool to find suspicious artifacts within executable files to accelerate the first malware assessment.
			-FLOSS		: A tool to deobfuscate strings from malwares.
			-PEView		: A static analysis tool that can be used to extract information about the PE header of an executable, specially the modules and the entry point.
			-DiE		: A program for determining types of files.
			-capa		: 
			
		Dynamic Analysis
		
			-IDA Pro / IDA Freeware
			-Inetsim
			-Netcat
			-TCPView
			-Procmon
			-Wireshark

			
B. Based on the US Cyber Command demo, what will be the possible cybersecurity implications to the PN
during the deployment of the US kit/tools to the PN network?
